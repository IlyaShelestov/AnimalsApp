# APIApp

This project serves as the third assignment for the **WEB Technologies 2** course at **Astana IT University**.

## Description

This web project is designed using **Bootstrap** for a responsive and user-friendly layout. It comprises *six* main sections: the **"Home"** page providing an overview of the project; the **"Cats"** page featuring two APIs for generating random cat photos and facts; the **"Weather"** page where users can retrieve weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherAPI; the **"Dictionary"** page for looking up word definitions; and the **"Profile"** page, which displays the user's search history across all APIs. Additionally, after successful **login** or **sign-up**, users gain access to these functionalities, with an extra **"Admin"** tab available to users logged in as admins, offering insights into all *users' account information*, actions like *Delete*, *Restore*, *Update*, *Insert*, and histories of *all users' searches* across the APIs.

The application utilizes four APIs: **OpenWeatherMap** for weather data, **TheCatAPI** for random cat photos, and **meowfacts** for interesting cat facts, and **Free Dictionary API** for retrieving word definitions. These APIs are integrated to enhance the user experience by providing dynamic content.

The backend is built with **Express**, and **EJS** is used for templating, ensuring efficient server-side rendering and a seamless interaction for users. **Mongoose** is integrated for easy data management with **MongoDB**, streamlining API development and data saving processes. For user session management, **Cookie-Parser** is employed to handle cookies efficiently, essential for maintaining logged-in user information.

3. Mongoose (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose);
4. Cookie-Parser (https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser);

## Used APIs

1. OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api);
2. TheCatAPI (https://developers.thecatapi.com/);
3. meowfacts (https://github.com/wh-iterabb-it/meowfacts);
4. Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/);

## Project Structure Overview

Frontend Directory (`./frontend/`):

The frontend directory houses all essential components required for the user interface of the application. It is organized into several subdirectories:

* **Views** (`./frontend/views/`): Contains EJS templates for rendering dynamic content on the web pages.
* **CSS** (`./frontend/css/`): Holds the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files for styling the web pages.
* **Partials** (`./frontend/views/partials/`): Includes reusable EJS partials for efficient template management.

Backend Directory (`./backend/`):

The backend directory forms the core of the application's server-side logic. It is composed of multiple components, each serving a specific purpose:

* **Controllers** (`./backend/controllers/`): This directory contains controller functions that interface with various APIs to fetch data. These controllers process the data and pass it to the routes for further handling.
* **Database** (`./backend/database/`): Includes functions dedicated to managing interactions between the routes and MongoDB Atlas collections. These functions facilitate data retrieval and updates to and from the database.
* **Routes** (`./backend/routes/`): Houses route handlers responsible for managing the application's endpoints. These handlers process incoming requests and, based on the defined routes, delegate tasks to the appropriate controllers or respond directly to the client.
* **Main Application File** (`./backend/app.js`): The entry point for starting the application. This file initializes and configures the application server.
* **Configuration** (`./backend/config.js`): Contains all necessary configurations for the application, such as database connection strings, API keys, and other environment-specific settings.
* **Helpers** (`./backend/helpers.js`): Provides auxiliary functions that support the interaction between different parts of the application, enhancing modularity and reusability.
* **Middleware** (`./backend/middleware.js`): Consists of middleware functions that execute during the request-response cycle.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, facilitating maintenance and scalability of the application.
